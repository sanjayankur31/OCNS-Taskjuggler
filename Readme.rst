Annual OCNS calendar using Taskjuggler
---------------------------------------

Annual OCNS calendar.
This is mainly for personal use, so that I remember what organisation tasks
need to be done, and when.

You need http://taskjuggler.org/ to generate the reports:
On Fedora, you can run:

.. code:: bash

    sudo dnf copr enable ankursinha/rubygem-taskjuggler
    sudo dnf install rubygem-taskjuggler


On other machines, you can install it using `gem` as noted on the `RubyGems.org page<https://rubygems.org/gems/taskjuggler>`__:


.. code:: bash

    gem install taskjuggler
